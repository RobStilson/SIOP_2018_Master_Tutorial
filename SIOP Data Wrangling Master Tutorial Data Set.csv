For example, AD&D or hospital indemnity are fine, but perhaps a more useful benefit to more employees would be identity theft insurance or parking. 

A parking benefit would have significant symbolic value. For example, have the pleasure of paying 1% of my salary to even go to work in the first place; it is a more significant percentage when you are towards the bottom of the Company salary range. I think there are a lot of leaders who travel and thus have all their parking expensed, and a significant portion of the higher-paid workforce works remotely, so I believe this has goes unnoticed. I think this should take priority over 401K matching on the benefits radar.","Reconsider our travel needs and budgets -  it seems we spend more than is necessary in this area, though admittedly I don't have a complete picture. One last minute trip for one person, flight/hotel/rental car/taxi/food per diem, easily equals 3-5% of some employee's annual salary.

Annual bonuses. What if we used the same bonus plan but ran it every quarter for 1/4 of the total? The quarterly bonuses can give a more immediate sense of whether we're doing well or doing poorly than an annual one.

I have seen so many people hired from the outside (jobs were never even posted) or people that are related and hired get special treatment. Part of the problem is that this is happening at the VP level.

We should make the local offices accessible again. I know the COE was to provide centralized service and that is ok for scheduling and whatnot but people get upset when they are calling a local office for directions and they get someone who cant tell them how to get there, they are then put on hold and then have to wait until we can locate someone.  
I have personally heard from clients how frustrating it is the several 'levels' they have to go through  to get someone on the phone. I actually herd from a paralegal at Wilson Elser that when they call in to the COE they are asked to take a survey to win a cruise. She said this was very off putting for a lot of firms and they don't have time to sit on hold and be marketed to about winning a cruise.","Personally I think the amount of information the COE is responsible for is outrageous. Some days I take 70 calls and we receive at least 10 emails a day about who is out, someone new to contact, what new scheduling procedure, a new process that has to be followed, some new rule on the ECS spreadsheet. I really have no idea how anyone is supposed to retain all of that and perform well and if a mistake is made you are certainly in trouble. The processes are way to lengthy. For example if someone needs a location request, not only do you have to spend 20 minutes scheduling the job on the phone with them, you then have to create a ticket for a location request, and log the phone call. Meanwhile you get 30 seconds to wrap up your call. Its almost virtually impossible to do all of this while you are on the phone, not have dead air and be able to finish.  These clients just want to call and be done with what they need. What ends up happening is a backlog is created and you have to request to go into 'work' to complete it but if the phones are busy that is denied. The job is extremely stressful and feels very 'sweat shop' like in many ways. 
The clients are also frustrated at the amount of hold time and what they have to go through to get to the office if they just left something there or they need direction. This goes for the reporters as well.","This is too time consuming between the talent quest goals, surveys, etc. We had to beg for time in the COE to complete the talent quest goals. Also, the last all employee call Terrie had we were unable to attend and have not been afforded the opportunity to watch it unless it is on our own time."
