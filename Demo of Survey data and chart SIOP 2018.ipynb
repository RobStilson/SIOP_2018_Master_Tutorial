    "# PURPOSE OF THE DATA WRANGLING MASTER TUTORIAL WITH R AND PYTHON\n",
    "The purpose of this Master Tutorial is to teach a bit of data wrangling on a typical social science data set derived from a survey. The purpose is NOT to teach you R or Python. That would be much better handled in a dedicated class on Coursera, Udemy, edX, etc (feel free to email me at robstilson@gmail.com if you would like recommendations). This tutorial jumps in at around an advanced beginner to intermediate level. Therefore the purpose is more around teaching data wrangling while laying the ground work for a Rosetta Stone type reference between R and Python."

    "Below we will import the needed packages. This is similar to the library() command in R. Notice the \"as\" after the import of the package. This creates an alias so instead of typing pandas.read_csv to import a .csv we can just type pd.read_csv. Unlike R, in Python you are essentially calling the commands from the package everytime you ran them. This can help to alleviate the confusion of like named functions. For instance in R if you run the describe() function, it will run the describe() function from the last package you installed. For a social scientist, this can become confusing when you have both the Hmisc and psych package loaded simultaneaously. In R you can get around this by using ::, so psych::describe() and Hmisc::describe(). This is never an issue in Python."

Notice however that instead of head(data) we are going to use data.head() with a period seperating the data frame from the function. This is why I tell those who I teach R to NEVER USE PERIODS in your naming conventions because if/when you also learn Python this can become very confusing.\n",

    "Also notice that we are grabbing the first 5 rows of the data, but they are indexed from 0:4. Python is a programming language that uses 0 indexing unlike R which uses 1 indexing. For more on this go [here](https://python-history.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-python-uses-0-based-indexing.html). Keep this in mind as it can also be very confusing when you are coming from an index 1 language."

    "[Tidy Data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf) by Hadley Wickham is an excellent read on how your data frames should be set up. The way I try to explain it is that in I/O Psychology we typically work with 1 row per person. This leads to very wide data sets as more variables are added. Especially with multiple metrics over multiple years (12 metrics by 3 years of montly data becomes 432 columns of data). A tall data set on the other hand is multiple rows per person with fewer columns. This also allows me to write one line of code to get the mean, SD, etc. for all of those variables instead of individually coding each of them. It is probably better to explain this visually, so I will send you to the excellent tutorial by Sean C. Anderson [here](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/). "

    "Melting (making tall or long) data in Python is fairly similar to how R does it with the reshape2 package. You will tell it the DF, in this case data, and then tell it the ID variables (e.g. not variables with values). Your new melted data frame will then contain those ID variables and will melt where all variables and their values become the last two columns. Don't fret if this seems confusing now. Start small and work your way up and I think once you start doing data manipulation with Tall data, it will become your go to method. It also makes data visualization much easier (in my opinion)."
